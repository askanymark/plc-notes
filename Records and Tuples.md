# Records and Tuples


• Ada, Haskell provide pure records and unions with good
compile-time type-checking
• C is flexible but very little type-checking harms safety
• Ada, Java, C record types have field names that are visible
only for values of the type
• Haskell record types have field names that are functions visible
everywhere
• Haskell supports the extraction of multiple components from
records and unions using pattern matching
• Lisp can model records using association lists, but
type-checking has to be explicitly programmed

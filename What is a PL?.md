# What is a PL?
Types:
- Imperative - uses statements to change a program's state. Focus on **how** a program operates. *(Perl, Ruby, Rust)*
- Procedural - based on a concept of procedure call. Procedures (aka functions, routines, etc.) contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. *(Ada, C, Go)*
- Object-oriented - based on the concept of objects. Programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. *(Java, C#, Python)*
- Logic - based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic PL is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain* (Prolog)*
- Functional - treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Done with expressions or declarations. *(Haskell, Erlang, Lisp)*


> A good PL must be expressive (can describe many algorithms), concise (no boring code), safe (errors are prevented or found asap), easy to read, executes efficiently, support reuse of code via abstraction, easy to learn, having good standard libraries. Depending on a PL concept!


**NB**: Boring code - if you want something done in Java, you create an ecosystem and *then *get it done. I.e.:

```java
print("Hello, World!"); // Python
vs
System.out.print("Hello, World!") // Java
```
